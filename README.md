I am useless when it comes to JS so don't judge and my html code might not be pretty but if it functions then thats good enough for me, maybe I will revamp it one day.

# stuff I used

This isn't a thorough documentation, I have linked the respective tools with their sites

* TSL certificate from [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)
* LAMP Web Stack // [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) + [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) + [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) + [PhP](https://www.php.net/)
* For watching my 3d print I used [Yawcam](https://www.yawcam.com/) steam server then port forwarded
* For the cursor effects I used [this](https://github.com/tholman/cursor-effects)
